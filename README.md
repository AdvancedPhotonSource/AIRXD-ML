# ARIXD-ML

ARiXD-ML stands for ARtifacts Identification of X-ray Diffraction data using Machine Learning methods. The aim of ARiXD-ML is to identify single crystal diffraction spots in 2D raw X-ray diffraction images using machine learning methods, reducing human efforts while lowering the computation cost. The current ML methods are:
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- CNN (under progress)
